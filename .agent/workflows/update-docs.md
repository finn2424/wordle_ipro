description: This workflow scans the repo for undocumented changes and updates the documentation files if necessary.
---

1. Check the repo for uncommitted changes, then check if they are already documented. If not, decide whether they should be documented and act accordingly (update the docs if necessary).
2. Now check the whole repo for undocumented changes and decide whether they should be documented and act accordingly (update the docs if necessary).
3. Present all the changes you made to the user and request feedback.
4. If the user provides feedback, act accordingly and memorize it, so it will be concidered the next time this workflow runs.
