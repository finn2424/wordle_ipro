# 🎮 Game Rules

Welcome to **Wordle IPRO**! This guide explains how to play and master the word-guessing game.

## 🎯 Objective

Guess the secret **5-letter word** within **6 attempts**.

## 📖 How to Play

1. **Type a 5-letter word** using your keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.
2. **Press Enter** to submit your guess.
3. After each guess, the tiles will change color to show **how close your guess was** to the secret word.

## 🟩🟨⬜ Color Clues

Each letter in your guess will be highlighted with one of three colors:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟩 **Green** | The letter is **correct** and in the **right position**. |
| 🟨 **Yellow** | The letter is in the word but in the **wrong position**. |
| ⬜ **Gray** | The letter is **not in the word** at all. |

### Example

If the secret word is **CRANE**:

- Guessing **C**LOUD → 🟩 The **C** is correct and in the right spot!
- Guessing T**R**UST → 🟨 The **R** is in the word but in the wrong position.
- Guessing **B**RICK → ⬜ The **B** is not in the word at all.

## ✅ Rules

- Each guess must be a **valid English word**.
- Invalid or incomplete words will not be accepted.
- Use the color hints to refine your next guess.
- letters can appear **more than once** in the secret word (e.g., "LEVEL").

## 💡 Tips & Strategies

1. **Start with vowel-rich words** – Try words like AUDIO, CRANE, or SLATE to quickly identify vowels.
2. **Avoid repeating gray letters** – Focus on letters you haven't tried yet.
3. **Pay attention to letter positions** – A yellow letter means it's correct but misplaced; try it in a different spot.
4. **Think about common letter patterns** – Consider frequent endings like -TION, -IGHT, or -ANCE.
5. **Use process of elimination** – Each guess should eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

## 🏆 Winning & Losing

- **You win** if you guess the word within 6 attempts! 🎉
- **You lose** if you use all 6 guesses without finding the word. 😔
